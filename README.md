Applications with Google Earth Engine


## Applications
While I have many projects with Google Earth Engine, I don't have any applications build. Here I started to produce several applications for my workflow. The first 2 applications are very novice in methodology and programming. The application in in 'Update" category is a more advance application and will be used as a guide for other projects to convert in.

### Projected
- Pending Information
### Update
- **Aerosols Examiner v1**: My first complex and advance application. Here 3 datasets are available to be queried over a designated region. The application is currently in testing mode and more modifcations and appendations are required.

### Active
- **Political Country Selection**: Application Allows the Download of various global database political administrative boundaries. Data libraries are from different sources and will be cited. 
	- (HPSCU) - High Precision Single Country Unstandardized, 
	- (HPSCGS) - High Precision Single Country Globally Standardized. 
	- (SSCU) - Simplified Single Country Unstandardized.
	- (SSCGS) - Simplified Single Country Globally Standardized.
	- (CGAZ) - Comprehensive Global Administrative Zones.

- **Topographic Terrain Inspection Tool**: from the Tagee repository allowing to  produce derivatives of elevation models, here the application takes in GLO30 from the ESA Copernicus system, the FABDEM (Forest and Buildings Removed GLO30), or the USGS 3DEP Model.
