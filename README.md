# Google-Earth-Engine
Applications with Google Earth Engine


## Applications
To streamline my workflow, I've begun creating a suite of applications. The initial two applications were relatively basic in terms of methodology and programming. However, the application currently in the "Update" category represents a more advanced approach and will serve as a template for converting other projects into applications

### Update
- [Google Earth Engine-App](https://ee-marcelluscampes.projects.earthengine.app/view/soils-exploratory-tool-in-progress-v11a) **Soils Visualization Tool (in-Progress) v1.1a**: This Google Earth Engine application is designed to show various properties of soils on a selected region. It will have two or more reference datasets (known as references) with binning applications such as elevation products and derivatives. The current datasets are the following: Soil Grids 250m v2.0 from the International Soil Reference and Information Centre (ISRIC) and the Soil Properties 800m from the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service.  The tool (or app) is in working progress and will be consistenly updated.

  		- Updated: Password Implimentation
  		- Updated: Menu System
  		- Updated: USDA Reference Datasets
  		- Updated: Color Palettes (All Datasets)
	- **FIXES** Version 1.0c

   		- Updated Citation System Menu
     	- Updated Menu System
     	- Update Reset System
	- **FIXES** Version 1.0b

 	- **UPLOAD** Version 1.0a

- [Google Earth Engine-App](https://ee-marcelluscampes.projects.earthengine.app/view/wetlands-exploratory-tool-in-progress-v10b) **Surface Wetland Visualization Tool v1.0a**: This Google Earth Engine application is designed to identify surface wetlands or irrigated areas within dense vegetation. Using Landsat 9 imagery and 3DEP elevation data from the USGS, it allows users to select a region, specify a time frame (start and end months, year), and adjust a threshold (particularly useful for flat plains) to estimate surface wetland extent.
	- Please note: This application is based on Landsat 9 OLI-2 sensor data and should be considered a tool for preliminary analysis. Definite conclusions should not be drawn solely from its results. Future development includes the ability to download the selected region's data.
	- Please allow time for image processing and a smaller footprint might result in better surface wetland returns.
 	- **Future Implimentations:** Algorithm on loose vegetation and download image option. Additional research will test the validity of the app's returns.
  	- **FIXES** Version 1.0b
  		- Updated: Disclaimer Information
  		- Updated: Passcode Implimentation
	- **UPLOAD** Version 1.0a
		- Creation and Testing.


- [Google Earth Engine-App](https://ee-marcelluscampes.projects.earthengine.app/view/aerosols-examiner-sensing-tool-v10d) **Aerosols Examiner v1.0d**: My first complex and advance application. Here 3 datasets are available to be queried over a designated region. The application is currently in testing mode and more modifcations and appendations are required.
	- **FIXES** Version 1.0d:
 		- Version Date Corrected
   		- Format Change
     	- ADD: Histograms (Testing; Issue is the number of returns on screen)
 	- **FIXES** Version 1.0c:
  		- Fix the Null Value through statistic reduction
    		- MAJOR ISSUE: MERRA Systems will require a hard code min/max values for all bands (and correct scale value)
 		- Grab Image Stats for Visualization
 		- PENDING: MEERA System Image Stats (Defaults to coded defaults)
 	- **FIXES** Version 1.0b:
  		- Layer name
		- Modifying Panel Text Info
		- Fixing Pop-Up Text Info
	- **UPLOAD** Version 1.0a
		- Testing Version for complex code.
  
### Active
- [Google Earth Engine-App](https://ee-marcelluscampes.projects.earthengine.app/view/political-country-selection) **Political Country Selection**: Application Allows the Download of various global database political administrative boundaries. Data libraries are from different sources and will be cited. 
	- (HPSCU) - High Precision Single Country Unstandardized[1][a] 
	- (HPSCGS) - High Precision Single Country Globally Standardized[1][a] 
	- (SSCU) - Simplified Single Country Unstandardized[1][a]
