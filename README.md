Applications with Google Earth Engine

**NOTES:**(9/16/2024) this readme is current being updated. 


## Applications
While I have many projects with Google Earth Engine, I don't have any applications build. Here I started to produce several applications for my workflow. The first 2 applications are very novice in methodology and programming. The application in in 'Update" category is a more advance application and will be used as a guide for other projects to convert in.

### Projected
-  Continue Updating **Aerosols Examiner** Tool (as this becomes a template for other plan sensing systems)
	-  Add Download Section
 	-  Add Charts Section
 	-  Add Point Extraction Explorer
  - Apps
  	- Soils
   	- Fire Delineations
    - Hydrological Delinations
    - Topography (Update: Topographic Terrain Inspection Tool)   
### Update
- [Google Earth Engine-App](https://ee-marcelluscampes.projects.earthengine.app/view/aerosols-examiner-v10c) **Aerosols Examiner v1.0b**: My first complex and advance application. Here 3 datasets are available to be queried over a designated region. The application is currently in testing mode and more modifcations and appendations are required.
 	- **FIXES** Version 1.0c:
  		- Fix the Null Value through statistic reduction
    		- MAJOR ISSUE: MERRA Systems will require a hard code min/max values for all bands (and correct scale value)
 		- Grab Image Stats for Visualization
 		- PENDING: MEERA System Image Stats (Defaults to coded defaults)
 	- **FIXES** Version 1.0b:
  		- Layer name
    	- Modifying Panel Text Info
      	- Fixing Pop-Up Text Info
    - To Append:
        - Add Statistics Charts
		- Add Implimentation to Skip 100% NULL Region
		- Add Download Option
  		- Improve Legend and Palette   
  
### Active
- [Google Earth Engine-App](https://ee-marcelluscampes.projects.earthengine.app/view/political-country-selection) **Political Country Selection**: Application Allows the Download of various global database political administrative boundaries. Data libraries are from different sources and will be cited. 
	- (HPSCU) - High Precision Single Country Unstandardized[1][a] 
	- (HPSCGS) - High Precision Single Country Globally Standardized[1][a] 
	- (SSCU) - Simplified Single Country Unstandardized[1][a]
	- (SSCGS) - Simplified Single Country Globally Standardized[1][a]
	- (CGAZ) - Comprehensive Global Administrative Zones.[1][a]
	- Author's: [Github](https://github.com/wmgeolab/geoBoundaries)
 	- NOTE: Requires Minor updates to App
  		- Format Subpanel

- [Google Earth Engine-App](https://ee-marcelluscampes.projects.earthengine.app/view/topographic-inspector)  **Topographic Terrain Inspection Tool**: from the Tagee repository allowing to  produce derivatives of elevation models, here the application takes in GLO30 [3] from the ESA Copernicus system, the FABDEM (Forest and Buildings Removed GLO30) [3], or the USGS 3DEP [4] Model.  
	- Author's [Github](https://github.com/zecojls/tagee), [Literature](https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/9/6/400)
 	- European Space Agency's Copernicus Programme [3]
  	- United States Geological Survey 3DEP [4]
  	- NOTE: Requires major update to the App
  		- Improvements on processing
  		- Error Checks
  		- Download Option
  	 	- Format Subpanel
